How to Call a Python Script from a Batch File and Register it in the
Windows 11 Start Menu

Overview
This document explains how to execute a Python script from a batch file
and register that batch file in the Windows 11 Start Menu. This will
allow you to run the Python script with a single click from the Start
Menu.

Prerequisites
- Python is installed and added to the PATH environment variable.
- The Python script you want to call is saved in any directory.

Steps

1. Creating the Batch File  
   Create a batch file to call the Python script.

   - Open a text editor, such as Notepad, and write the following:

       py disp_btct_ctrl.py -target "\\.\DISPLAY5" -brightness 10 -contrast 30

   - Save the file with a name. For example, name it brightness_middle.bat.

2. Create a Shortcut for the Batch File

   - Create a shortcut in the same directory (or any folder) for the
     batch file (e.g., run_python_script.bat).
     - Right-click on the file and select “Create shortcut.”

3. Configure the Shortcut for Registration in the Start Menu

   - Open the properties of the shortcut.
     - Right-click on the shortcut and select “Properties.”

   - Edit the “Target” field as follows:
     - Add cmd.exe /c at the beginning, and surround the original path
       with double quotes (" ").

       Example:
       cmd.exe /c "C:\your_path\bightness_middle.bat"

   - Click “Apply” to save the settings.

   - Change the icon or filename of the shortcut to make it easier to
     recognize in the Start Menu.
     - For example, naming it something like "Brightness 10" can make it
       more identifiable.

   - Right-click on the shortcut and select “Pin to Start.”

Now, you can run the Python script via the batch file directly from the
Start Menu. This method allows you to register the Python script in the
Start Menu and execute it with a single click.
