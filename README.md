# disp_btct_ctrl.py

`disp_btct_ctrl.py` is a Python script for controlling monitor brightness and contrast on Windows.  
It leverages the DDC/CI protocol to adjust compatible displays.

## Features
- Set brightness for a specified display
- Set contrast for a specified display

## Requirements
- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- Python 3.6 or higher
- DDC/CI-compatible display

## Installation

1. Install the required packages.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. The script `disp_btct_ctrl.py` is now ready to use.

## Usage

Run the script from the command line and specify brightness and contrast settings using the following options:

```bash
python disp_btct_ctrl.py -target "\\.\DISPLAY12" -brightness 50 -contrast 70
```

### Options

- `-target`: The device name of the display to control (e.g., `\\.\DISPLAY12`)
- `-brightness`: Brightness level (0-100)
- `-contrast`: Contrast level (0-100)

### Example

```bash
# Set brightness to 50 and contrast to 70 for DISPLAY12
python disp_btct_ctrl.py -target "\\.\DISPLAY12" -brightness 50 -contrast 70
```

If no command-line arguments are provided, the script will list all connected displays.

## Notes
- This script requires that the monitor supports DDC/CI.
- Some displays or specific settings may not be controllable.

I frequently switch brightness settings to suit either coding or gaming. However, the PC’s built-in tools and monitor’s OSD are often inconvenient or unsupported, so I created this to control the display settings more effectively.
Most of the code and documentation were generated by ChatGPT. While I supervised and made adjustments, I haven't allocated much of my own resources to it.
Please feel free to modify it to suit your own purposes and environment as needed.

## Development

Dependencies for development are listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Installing Development Dependencies

To include development tools, install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Tested Environments

- **ASUS G14 + ASUS VG27AQ**

**Note:** This script has only been tested with the above setup. It has not been tested on other monitors. Use at your own risk and responsibility.

## Extras

### disp_id.py

`disp_id.py` is a supplementary script that displays each connected monitor's Device ID in a large window at the center of each screen for identification purposes. Each identification window closes automatically after 2 seconds.

#### Usage

To run the script, simply execute:

```bash
python disp_id.py
```

This will display each monitor’s Device ID in a window on that monitor, with the ID printed to the console as well. The script automatically closes all windows after 3 seconds.

#### Example Console Output

```plaintext
Monitor 1: \\.\DISPLAY1
Monitor 2: \\.\DISPLAY2
```

This can be helpful for identifying monitor configurations or confirming display settings.
